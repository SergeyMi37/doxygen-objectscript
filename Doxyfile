# Doxyfile 1.9.8

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
#
# Note:
#
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
# replacement variables:
# doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "My Project"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./docs

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:^^"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". Note that you cannot put \n's in the value part of an alias
# to insert newlines (in the resulting output). You can put ^^ in the value part
# of an alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original
# file. When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you
# have to escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts
# with the commands \{ and \} for these it is advised to use the version @{ and
# @} or use a double escape (\\{ and \\})

ALIASES                += "param=\xrefitem param \"Parameter\" \"Parameters\""
ALIASES                += "prop=\xrefitem prop \"Property\" \"Properties\""
ALIASES                += "classmethod=\xrefitem classmethod \"ClassMethod\" \"ClassMethods\""
ALIASES                += "method=\xrefitem method \"Method\" \"Methods\""
ALIASES                += "index=\xrefitem index \"Index\" \"Indices\""

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, Lex, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice,
# VHDL, Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen. When specifying no_extension you should add
# * to the FILE_PATTERNS.
#
# Note see also the list of default file extension mappings.

EXTENSION_MAPPING      = cls=C++

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = ./src

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.
#
# Note the list of default checked file patterns might differ from the list of
# default file extension mappings.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cxxm,
# *.cpp, *.cppm, *.c++, *.c++m, *.java, *.ii, *.ixx, *.ipp, *.i++, *.inl, *.idl,
# *.ddl, *.odl, *.h, *.hh, *.hxx, *.hpp, *.h++, *.ixx, *.l, *.cs, *.d, *.php,
# *.php4, *.php5, *.phtml, *.inc, *.m, *.markdown, *.md, *.mm, *.dox (to be
# provided as doxygen C comment), *.py, *.pyw, *.f90, *.f95, *.f03, *.f08,
# *.f18, *.f, *.for, *.vhd, *.vhdl, *.ucf, *.qsf and *.ice.

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# The FILTER_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify filters on a per file pattern
# basis. Doxygen will compare the file name with each pattern and apply the
# filter if there is a match. The filters are a list of the form: pattern=filter
# (like *.cpp=my_cpp_filter). See INPUT_FILTER for further information on how
# filters are used. If the FILTER_PATTERNS tag is empty or if none of the
# patterns match the file name, INPUT_FILTER is applied.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# properly processed by doxygen.

FILTER_PATTERNS        = *.cls=./cachefilter.py

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE =

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by doxygen has an example that
# shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index, you could
# consider setting DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# The NUM_PROC_THREADS specifies the number of threads doxygen is allowed to use
# during processing. When set to 0 doxygen will based this on the number of
# cores available in the system. You can set it explicitly to a value larger
# than 0 to get more control over the balance between CPU load and processing
# speed. At this moment only the input processing can be done using multiple
# threads. Since this is still an experimental feature the default is set to 1,
# which effectively disables parallel processing. Please report any issues you
# encounter. Generating dot graphs in parallel is controlled by the
# DOT_NUM_THREADS setting.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 32, default value: 1.

NUM_PROC_THREADS       = 0

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.
EXTRACT_PRIVATE = YES
